    "desc_long": "BearSSL is an implementation of the SSL/TLS protocol (RFC 5246)\nwritten in C. It aims at offering the following features:\n\n* Be correct and secure. In particular, insecure protocol versions and\n  choices of algorithms are not supported, by design; cryptographic\n  algorithm implementations are constant-time by default.\n\n* Be small, both in RAM and code footprint. For instance, a minimal\n  server implementation may fit in about 20 kilobytes of compiled code\n  and 25 kilobytes of RAM.\n\n* Be highly portable. BearSSL targets not only \u201cbig\u201d operating systems\n  like Linux and Windows, but also small embedded systems and even\n  special contexts like bootstrap code.\n\n* Be feature-rich and extensible. SSL/TLS has many defined cipher\n  suites and extensions; BearSSL should implement most of them, and\n  allow extra algorithm implementations to be added afterwards,\n  possibly from third parties.\n",
