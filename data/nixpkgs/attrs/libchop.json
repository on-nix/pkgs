    "desc_long": "Libchop is a set of utilities and library for data backup and\n        distributed storage.  Its main application is chop-backup, an\n        encrypted backup program that supports data integrity checks,\n        versioning at little cost, distribution among several sites,\n        selective sharing of stored data, adaptive compression, and more.\n        The library itself, which chop-backup builds upon, implements\n        storage techniques such as content-based addressing, content hash\n        keys, Merkle trees, similarity detection, and lossless compression.\n        It makes it easy to combine them in different ways.  The\n        \u2018chop-archiver\u2019 and \u2018chop-block-server\u2019 tools, illustrated in the\n        manual, provide direct access to these facilities from the command\n        line.  It is written in C and has Guile (Scheme) bindings.\n",
