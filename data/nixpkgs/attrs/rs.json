    "desc_long": "rs reads the standard input, interpreting each line as a row of blank-\nseparated entries in an array, transforms the array according to the op-\ntions, and writes it on the standard output. With no arguments (argc < 2)\nit transforms stream input into a columnar format convenient for terminal\nviewing, i.e. if the length (in bytes!) of the first line is smaller than\nthe display width, -et is implied, -t otherwise.\n\nThe shape of the input array is deduced from the number of lines and the\nnumber of columns on the first line. If that shape is inconvenient, a more\nuseful one might be obtained by skipping some of the input with the -k\noption. Other options control interpretation of the input columns.\n\nThe shape of the output array is influenced by the rows and cols specifi-\ncations, which should be positive integers. If only one of them is a po-\nsitive integer, rs computes a value for the other which will accommodate\nall of the data. When necessary, missing data are supplied in a manner\nspecified by the options and surplus data are deleted. There are options\nto control presentation of the output columns, including transposition of\nthe rows and columns.\n",
